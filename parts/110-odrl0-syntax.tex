\section{Introduction}

We follow the style of~\cite{pucella2006} by using abstract syntax to express policy statements in \ac{ACCPL}. Abstract syntax is a more compact representation than XML which is what all the XML-based policy languages such \ac{odrl} use. Furthermore abstract syntax simplifies specifying the semantics as we shall see later. 

In the following we will cover the abstract syntax of \ac{ACCPL} that we later implement in Coq using constructs such as inductive types and definitions. 


\section{Environmental Facts}\label{sec:odrl0}
To determine the outcome of policies, specified conditions in those policies are evaluated but to do so environmental facts are often needed. In the \ac{drm} realm with its focus on usage control, certain facts are typically tracked in the environment. The count of how many times an asset has been accessed, the amount a user has paid to access an asset and finally whether a user has made an attribution (e.g. mentioning the content owner by name) are examples of the kind of facts environments hold.

In \ac{ACCPL}, agreements and facts (i.e. environments) will refer to a count of how many times each policy should be used and has been used respectively, to justify an action. This is the only fact that \ac{ACCPL} will cover although we conjecture adding other simple facts such as attributions and ``amounts paid'' and the machinery to support those facts should not change the verification goals and results so far of \ac{ACCPL}. We will defer to later in the thesis (see section~\ref{sec:missingreqs}), the discussion of how and whether more general and complex facts in the environment will impact \ac{ACCPL} and our verification results.   

In \ac{ACCPL} a prerequisite is either True, a constraint, the negation of a constraint or a conjunction of prerequisites. True is the prerequisite that always holds. Constraints are facts that are outside of control of users. For example, there is nothing Alice can do to satisfy the constraint ``user must be Bob''. 


We will describe \ac{ACCPL} in a \emph{BNF} grammar that looks more like Pucella and Weissman's subset grammar~\cite{pucella2006}. BNF style grammars are more abstract as they only give suggestions about the surface syntax of expressions without getting into lexical analysis and parsing related aspects such as precedence order of operators~\cite{piercesf2011}. The Coq version in contrast is the encodings of the BNF definitions which is tyically used for building compilers and interpreters. We will present both the BNF definition and its Coq encoding for each construct of \ac{ACCPL}. 


\section{Productions} \label{sec:productionast}

The top level \ac{ACCPL} production is the \syn{<agreement>}. An agreement expresses what actions a set of subjects may perform on an object and under what conditions. Syntactically an agreement is composed of a set of subjects/users called a principal or \syn{<prin>}, an \syn{<asset>} and a \syn{<policySet>} (see listing~\ref{lst:agreementast}).

% agreement
\lstset{language=AST}
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.95\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={agreement},label={lst:agreementast}]
<agreement> ::= 
     'agreement' 'for' <prin> 'about' <asset> 'with' <policySet> 
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage} 

Principals (\syn{<prin>}) are composed of \syn{<subject>}s which are specified based on the application e.g. \syn{Alice}, \syn{Bob}, etc (see listing~\ref{lst:prinast}).

% prin
\lstset{mathescape, language=AST}  
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={prin},label={lst:prinast}]
<prin> ::=  { <subject$_{1}$>, ..., <subject$_{m}$> }
\end{lstlisting}

Assets are also application specific and we will continue using specific ones for the \ac{drm} application (taken from~\cite{pucella2006}). \syn{TheReport}, \syn{ebook}, and \syn{latestJingle} are examples of specific assets we will be using throughout (see listing~\ref{lst:assetast}). 

% asset
\lstset{mathescape, language=AST}  
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={asset},label={lst:assetast}]
<asset> ::= TheReport | ebook | latestJingle | ...
\end{lstlisting}

Subjects are treated similarly to assets. We will use specific and application specific assets like \syn{Alice} and \syn{Bob} (see listing~\ref{lst:subjectast}).

% subject
\lstset{mathescape, language=AST}  
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={subject},label={lst:subjectast}]
<subject> ::= Alice | Bob | ...
\end{lstlisting}

Agreements express who may perform an action on an asset. They include a set of subjects (i.e. a principal), an asset and a policy set. A policy set is a primitive policy set implying non-nested policy sets. Note that we could define various combining operators for policy sets such as conjunctions and disjunctions but we keep \ac{ACCPL}'s policy sets limited to the primitive kind. We do however, use a policy combining operator when it comes to dealing with policies later on. Each primitive policy set specifies a \syn{<prerequisite>} and a \syn{<policy>}. Intuitively if the prerequisite ``holds'' the policy is taken into consideration. Otherwise the policy will not be looked at (see listing~\ref{lst:policySetast}).


% policySet
\newcommand*{\Comment}[1]{\hfill\makebox[7.0cm][l]{#1}}%
\lstset{mathescape, language=AST, escapechar=\&}  
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.95\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={policySet and primPolicySet},label={lst:policySetast}]
<policySet> ::=  
   <primPolicySet>	&\Comment{; primitive policy set }&
   
<primPolicySet> ::=  
    <primInclusivePolicySet>	&\Comment{; primitive inclusive policy set }&
 |  <primExclusivePolicySet>	&\Comment{; primitive exclusive policy set }&
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

Some primitive policy sets are specified as inclusive as opposed to others that are explicitly specified as exclusive. Primitive exclusive policy sets are exclusive to an agreement's users in that only those users may perform the actions specified in the policy set. The implication is that all other users who are not specified in the agreement's principal are forbidden from performing the specified actions, no matter whether the prerequisite holds or not (see listing~\ref{lst:primExclusivePolicySetast}).

% primExclusivePolicySet
\lstset{mathescape, language=AST, escapechar=\&}  
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={primExclusivePolicySet},label={lst:primExclusivePolicySetast}]
<primExclusivePolicySet> ::=  
   <prerequisite> $\mapsto$ <policy>	&\Comment{; primitive exclusive policy set }&
\end{lstlisting}

Not surprisingly we also define primitive inclusive policy sets that don't enforce any exclusivity to the agreement's users (see listing~\ref{lst:primInclusivePolicySetast}).

% primInclusivePolicySet
\lstset{mathescape, language=AST, escapechar=\&}  
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={primInclusivePolicySet},label={lst:primInclusivePolicySetast}]
<primInclusivePolicySet> ::=  
   <prerequisite> $\rightarrow$ <policy>	&\Comment{; primitive inclusive policy set }&
\end{lstlisting}


A primitive policy specifies an action to be performed on an asset, depending on whether the policy's prerequisite holds or not. If the prerequisite holds the agreement's user is permitted to perform the action on the agreement's asset; otherwise permission is denied. Pucella and Weissman's subset of \ac{odrl}~\cite{pucella2006} specifies a unique identifier for each policy to help the translation (from agreements to formulas). \ac{ACCPL} has maintained the policy identifier and we include it here in our definition of the policy construct, however, as far as the proofs are concerned the policy identifier could be removed without a loss to the obtained results (see listing~\ref{lst:primPolicyast}).

% primitive policy

\lstset{mathescape, language=AST, escapechar=\&}  
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.95\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={primPolicy},label={lst:primPolicyast}]
<primPolicy> ::=  
   <prerequisite> $\Rightarrow_{<policyId>}$ <act> 	&\Comment{; primitive policy}&
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

A policy is made up of primitive policies. Primitive policies are grouped together using the conjunction combining operator (see listing~\ref{lst:policyast}).

% policy
\lstset{mathescape, language=AST, escapechar=\&}  
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.95\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={policy},label={lst:policyast}]
<policy> ::=  
 'and'[ <primPolicy$_{1}$>, ..., 
                 <primPolicy$_{m}$> ]	&\Comment{; conjunction }&
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

Similar to assets and subjects, actions are application specific and we use specific ones taken from~\cite{pucella2006} such as \syn{Display} and \syn{Print} (see listing~\ref{lst:actast}).

% act
\lstset{mathescape, language=AST}  
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={act},label={lst:actast}]
<act> ::= Play | Print | Display | ...
\end{lstlisting}

A policy identifier (\syn{<policyId>}) is a unique identifier specified as (increasing) positive integers (see listing~\ref{lst:policyIdast}).

% id
\lstset{mathescape, language=AST}  
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={policyId},label={lst:policyIdast}]
<policyId> ::= N
\end{lstlisting}

In \ac{ACCPL} a \syn{<primPrerequisite>} is either True or it is a \syn{<constraint>}. The True prerequisite always holds. A constraint is an intrinsic part of a policy and cannot be influenced by agreement's users. Minimum height requirements for popular attractions and rides are examples of what we would consider a constraint. A constraint can also be negative, specified by the keyword `not' in front of \syn{<constraint>}. A \syn{<prerequisite>} is a set of primitive prerequisites which are closed under conjunction operator specified by the keyword `and' in front of the list of the primitive prerequisites separated by commas (see listing~\ref{lst:preRequisiteast}).

% prq

\lstset{mathescape, language=AST, escapechar=\&}  
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={prerequisite},label={lst:preRequisiteast}]
<primPrerequisite> ::=  
       'True' &\Comment{; always true}&
    |  <constraint>	 &\Comment{; constraint}&
    |  'not' [ <constraint> ] &\Comment{; suspending constraint}&
    
<prerequisite> ::=    
    |  'and'[ <primPrerequisite$_{1}$>, ..., <primPrerequisite$_{m}$> ] &\Comment{; conjunction }&
\end{lstlisting}

Constraints are either of the principal kind, the count kind, or the count by principle kind. Principal constraints require matching to the users listed following the keyword \syn{<prin>}. For example, the constraint of ``the user being Alice'' is a constraint of type principal. A count constraint refers to the number of times the user of an agreement has invoked policies to justify her actions. If the count constraint is part of a policy then the count refers to that single policy. In the case that the count constraint is part of a policy set or if the policy is a conjunction, then the count refers to the set of policies specified in the policy set or in the policy conjunction as the case may be (see listing~\ref{lst:constraintast}).

% constraint
\lstset{mathescape, language=AST, escapechar=\&}  
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.95\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption={constraint},label={lst:constraintast}]
<constraint> ::=  
       <prin> &\Comment{; principal}&
    |  'Count' [N] &\Comment{; number of executions}&
    |  <prin> ('Count' [N]) &\Comment{; number of executions by prin}&
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
