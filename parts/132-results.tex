The tension in designing a policy language is usually between how to make the language expressive enough, such that the design goals for the policy language may be expressed, and how to make the policies verifiable with respect to the stated goals. A central question or goal in policy language design is whether a permission is implied by a set of policy statements. This is referred to as the decidability problem in this thesis. For example, Halpern and Weissman~\cite{HalpernW08} show that in general determining whether a permission is implied by a set of policy statements in \ac{xrml} is undecidable whereas Pucella and Weissman show that answering such questions is decidable but NP-hard for \ac{odrl}~\cite{pucella2006}.
 

We had set out to prove formally that the \ac{ACCPL} language was decidable. Recall that we specified the semantics of \ac{ACCPL} using a translation from policy statements together with an access request and an environment containing all relevant facts, to decisions. The goal was to use the translation algorithm to determine when a request for accessing a resource is implied by a given policy, when the request is not implied by the policy and finally when the request is not regulated by the given policy. More importantly we wanted to show that answering access requests always produced a decision and that the translation algorithm terminated on all input policies with a decision of \syn{Permitted}, \syn{NotPermitted} or \syn{Unregulated}. In this chapter we discuss the decidability proofs and other main results we had set out to accomplish. We will also show that the translation algorithm meets its specification and computes the correct decision, with respect to its specification, given a policy. 


\ac{ACCPL} started out as a reduced version of Pucella and Weissman's subset of \ac{odrl}\\~\cite{pucella2006} but based on the direction of the proofs we were developing significant changes had to be made to Pucella and Weissman's language to make the proofs possible. An important lesson learned was that the process of designing a certifiable policy language cannot be done in isolation since while certifiability of the language derives the design one way, expressiveness requirements of the language usually drive it in the opposite direction. Certifiability cannot be a post-design activity as the changes it will impose are often fundamental ones.

In the following section we will list the main theorems that we have proved and the supporting theorems that needed to be proved to lead up to the main results. In general however we will not show the actual proofs in the dissertation (with some exceptions) and instead refer the reader to the GitHub repository where the source code for \ac{ACCPL}, including the proofs, lives~\cite{BahmanSistany2015}.

\section{Decidability of ACCPL}\label{sec:maintheorems}

The theorem \syn{trans_agreement_dec2} is the declaration of the main decidability result for \ac{ACCPL} (see listing~\ref{lst:agreementdecidablecoq}). Together with other theorems we will describe below, we have ``certified'' \ac{ACCPL} decidable by proving this theorem. The nonempty list that the agreement translation function \syn{trans_agreement} returns will contain results one per each primitive policy (\syn{primPolicy}) found in the agreement. Specifically the predicate \syn{isResultInQueryResult} takes a \syn{result} and a nonempty list of \syn{result}'s which \syn{trans_agreement} produces, and calls the \syn{In} predicate. The \syn{In} predicate is adapted from the \syn{Coq.Lists.List} standard library and checks for the existence of the input \syn{result} in the nonempty list of results. Definitions for predicates \syn{isResultInQueryResult} and \syn{In} are listed in listing~\ref{lst:agreementdecidablecoq}. The definitions for \syn{answer} and \syn{result} are repeated in the same listing. 

As an example and also a visual aid to understanding how queries are answered, see listing~\ref{lst:permittedcoq}. The \syn{isResultInQueryResult} predicate looks for a result with an answer of Permitted in the list that \syn{trans_agreement} has produced, for an agreement for three primitive policies (since the set contains three results). In words, we are asking whether \syn{Alice} is \syn{Permitted} to \syn{Print} the \syn{ebook} given a policy.

(Result Permitted Alice Print ebook) 
[ (Result Unregulated Alice Print ebook) ; (Result Unregulated Alice Print ebook) ; (Result Permitted Alice Print ebook) ]
\end{lstlisting}
%\end{minipage}
    
In the case where the whole set is not comprised of \syn{Unregulated} results, we have two mutually exclusive cases. The first case is when the set has a at least one \syn{Permitted} result; we answer the access query in this case with a result of \syn{Permitted} (this would be the case in the listing~\ref{lst:permittedcoq}). The second case is when the set has at least one \syn{NotPermitted}; we answer the access query in this case with a result of \syn{NotPermitted}.

    (trans_agreement e ag action_from_query subject_from_query asset_from_query))).

\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

Typically most, if not all of the results will be of type \syn{Unregulated}. In the case where all the results are \syn{Unregulated} we answer the access query with a result of \syn{Unregulated}. We show this case indirectly in the theorem in listing~\ref{lst:agreementdecidablecoq} by stating the set does not contain a \syn{Permitted} result nor a \syn{NotPermitted} result. 

\section{Mutual Exclusivity of \syn{Permitted} and \syn{NotPermitted}}\label{sec:mutualexclusive}

The \syn{trans_agreement_perm_implies_not_notPerm_dec} (see listing~\ref{lst:permimpliesnotnotperm}) says that the existence of a \syn{Permitted} result in the set of results returned by \syn{trans_agreement}, excludes a \syn{NotPermitted} result.


\lstset{language=Coq, frame=single, caption={\syn{Permitted} result Implies no \syn{NotPermitted} result},label={lst:permimpliesnotnotperm}}

    (isResultInQueryResult 
      (Result Permitted subject_from_query action_from_query asset_from_query)

      (Result NotPermitted subject_from_query action_from_query asset_from_query)
       (trans_agreement e ag action_from_query subject_from_query asset_from_query)).
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}


The  \syn{trans_agreement_NotPerm_implies_not_Perm_dec} (see listing~\ref{lst:notpermimpliesnotperm}) shows that the existence of a \syn{NotPermitted} result in the set of results returned by \syn{trans_agreement}, excludes a \syn{Permitted} result.

\lstset{language=Coq, frame=single, caption={\syn{NotPermitted} result Implies no \syn{Permitted} result},label={lst:notpermimpliesnotperm}}

      (Result NotPermitted subject_from_query action_from_query asset_from_query)
        (trans_agreement e ag action_from_query subject_from_query asset_from_query)) ->

   ~(isResultInQueryResult 
      (Result Permitted subject_from_query action_from_query asset_from_query)
       (trans_agreement e ag action_from_query subject_from_query asset_from_query)).
\end{lstlisting}
%\end{minipage}

Finally the proof for \syn{trans_agreement_not_Perm_and_ \newline NotPerm_at_once} establishes that both \syn{Permitted} and \syn{NotPermitted} results cannot exist in the same set returned by \syn{trans_agreement} (see listing~\ref{lst:permandnotpermmutualexclusive}). This result also establishes the fact that in \ac{ACCPL} rendering conflicting decisions is not possible given an agreement. 

Note that the ``no conflict'' result does not apply across agreements. In particular, we don't handle the case of multiple agreements with the same asset and set of users which may be an interesting sub-case. The result applies to a single agreement and specifically to the \syn{<policySet>} field of an agreement. Recall that the \syn{<policySet>} element expands into the \syn{<policy>} element which in turn contains multiple \syn{<primPolicy>}s each with multiple \syn{<preRequisite>}s. In this way, we cover the majority of cases that conflict detection algorithms typically cover, including the most difficult ones.

%\end{minipage}

The proof for the next theorem \syn{trans_agreement_not_NotPerm_and_not_Perm \newline _implies_Unregulated_dec} shows that in the case where neither a \syn{Permitted} nor a \syn{NotPermitted} result exists in the set returned by \syn{trans_agreement}, there does exist at least one \syn{Unregulated} result (see listing~\ref{lst:notpermandnotpermimpliesunregulated}).

\section{Decidable As An Inductive Predicate}

We encode the cases discussed in section~\ref{sec:maintheorems} in an inductively defined predicate called \syn{decidable} in listing~\ref{lst:inductivepredicatedecidablecoq}. Recall that the nonempty list that the agreement translation function \syn{trans_agreement} returns will return a set of results one per each \syn{primPolicy}.There are three cases. First when there is at least a \syn{NotPermitted} result in the set and there is no \syn{Permitted} result, second when there is at least a \syn{Permitted} result in the set and no \syn{NotPermitted} result, and third when there are no \syn{Permitted} and no \syn{NotPermitted} results in the set. We encode these three cases in three constructors for the type \syn{decidable}. The constructors are: \syn{Denied}, \syn{Granted} and \syn{NotApplicable}. Notice that we use \syn{Denied}, \syn{Granted} and \syn{NotApplicable} synonymously with \syn{NotPermitted}, \syn{Permitted} and \syn{Unregulated}. The reason is a practical one and is due to Coq; we needed to use new names for the \syn{decidable} constructors since we already used \syn{NotPermitted}, \syn{Permitted} and \syn{Unregulated} as constructors for \syn{answer}.

We declare and prove the decidability of \ac{ACCPL} in terms of the \syn{decidable} predicate as seen in listing~\ref{lst:decidabletypecoq}. The proof is made simple since we use the previously proven theorem \syn{trans_agreement_dec2}. The proof also makes use of two theorems we saw earlier in section~\ref{sec:mutualexclusive}. Recall that the first theorem, \syn{trans_agreement_perm_implies_not_notPerm_dec}, says that the existence of a \syn{Permitted} result in the set of results returned by \syn{trans_agreement}, will exclude any \syn{NotPermitted} result and that the second theorem, \syn{trans_agreement_NotPerm_implies_not_Perm_dec}, shows that the existence of a \syn{NotPermitted} result in the set of results returned by \syn{trans_agreement}, will exclude a \syn{Permitted} result. The proof shows the series of tactics that were applied to 
complete the proof interactively.  We do not explain the tactics here, but just show the proof to illustrate by example what proofs look like.

We will list the intermediate theorems that we have declared and proved which are used in the proof of theorem \syn{trans_agreement_dec2} and subsequent proofs in section~\ref{sec:intermediatetheorems}.
