\begin{center}\textbf{Dedication}\end{center}

This thesis is dedicated to my wife Sanam who stood by me and kept me going when life threatened to get in the way, and to my wonderful sons Roitan and Rod Barzin for their sacrifice and patience during the course of my PhD studies. 

I also dedicate this work to my parents, Shamseddin and Robab, who first taught me the value of education and for their continued encouragement and support throughout my studies.
