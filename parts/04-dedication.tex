\begin{center}\textbf{Dedication}\end{center}

This thesis is dedicated to my wife Sanam, and to my sons Roitan and Rod Barzin for their continued support, sacrifice and encouragement during the course of my PhD studies. 

I also dedicate this work to my parents, Shamseddin and Robab, who first taught me the value of education and for their continued encouragement throughout my studies.
